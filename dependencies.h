 }

arrput pushes the value onto the end of the dynamic array (like std::vector.push_back), so the above code will print 2 3 5.

Note that these macros write to the array variable if the array has to be resized.
This means that if you pass a dynamic array into a function which increases its length,
you need to return the updated array from the function to its caller.
In other words, the semantics are the same as any realloc()-ed pointer,
and are unlike the semantics of things like std::vector<>, where the core object is stable even if the array elements aren't.

The following functions are defined:

    arrlen - the length of the dynamic array
    arrlenu - the length of the dynamic array as an unsigned type
    arrput - copy an object into the dynamic array
    arrfree - free the entire array
    arraddn - adds n uninitialized values to the dynamic array
    arrsetlen - sets the length of the array (leaves new slots uninitialized)
    arrlast - the last item in the array as an lvalue
    arrins - inserts an item in the middle of the array
    arrdel - deletes an item from the middle of the array, moving the following items over
    arrswapdel - deletes an item from the middle of the array, replacing it with the formerly last item
    arrcap - returns the internal capacity, the maximum length the array can be without reallocating it
    arrsetcap - sets the internal capacity. it is not possible to shrink the capacity (currently)
